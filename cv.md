3. **This is my story**
When I was in school, I discovered my desire to design mechanisms. After a while, I entered the university. For a specialty - a developer. Now I am the main developer ... I understand that I can be of much more value. Therefore, I decided to become a student at RS School.
My four main qualities:
- interest in learning new things;
- sociability;
- honesty;
- openness
I try to quickly learn everything new that is necessary for work. I like to constantly develop and achieve my goals.
